01 - Present continous


B)

I am doing someting = I'm in the middle of doing something; I've started doing it and I haven't finished yet.

Often the action is happening at the time of of speaking.
    • Please don't make so much noise. I'm working.
    • Let's go out now. It isn't raining any more. (not 'it doesn't rain')
    • (at a party) Hello, Jane. Are you enjoying the party? (not 'do you enjoy')
    • I'm tired. I'm going to bed now.

But the action is not necessarily happening at the time of speaking. For example:

Tom and Ann are talking in a cafe. Tom says:
	
    • I'm reading an interesting book at the moment. I'll lend it to you when I've finished it.
	
Tom is not reading the book at the time of speaking. He means that he has started it but not finished yet. He is in the middle of reading it.

Some more examples:
    • Catherine wants to work in Italy, so she is learning Italian.
    • Some friends of mine are building their own house. They hope it will be finished before next summer.


C)

We use the present continous when we talk about things happening in a period around now (for example, today / this week / this evening etc.):
    • You're working hard today. Yes, I have a lot to do. (not 'you work hard toady')
    • Is Susan working this week? No, she's on holiday.

We use the present continous when we talk about changes happening around now:
    • The population of the world is rising very fast. (not 'rises')
    • Is your English getting better? (not 'does your English get better')

A)

Alex is a bus driver, but now he is in a bed asleep. So: He is not driving a bus. (He is asleep.) but He drives a bus. (He is a bus driver.)


B)

We use the present simple to talk about things in general. We are not thinking only about now. We use it to say that something happens all the time or repeatedly, or that something is true in general. It is not important whether the action is happening at the time of speaking.
    • Nurses look after patients in hospitals.
    • I usually go away at weekends.
    • The earth goes round the sun.

    • Where do you come from?
    • I don't smoke.
    • What does this word mean?
    • Rice doesn't grow in cold climate.

In the following examples do is also the main verb:
    • What do you do? (What's your job?) I work in a shop.
    • He's so lazy. He doesn't do anything to help me.

D)

We use the present simple to say how often we do things:
    • I get up at 8 o'clock every morning. (not I'm getting)
    • How often do you go to the dentist?
    • Ann doesn't drink tea very often.
    • In summer John usually plays tennis once or twice a week.

E)

I promise / I apologise 
Sometimes we do things by saying something. We use the present simple in sentences like this:
    • I promise I won't be late.

What do you suggest I do? I suggest that you call him first.

04 - Present continuous and present simple (2)


A)

We use continous tenses only for actions and happenings (they're eating / it is raining). Some verbs (know, like) are not action verbs.

    • Do you understand what I mean?

    • We have (possess) a nice room in the hotel. but

B)

We normally use the present simple with these verbs:
    • Do you see that man over there? (not are you seeing)
    • This room smells. Let's open a window.
We often use can + see/hear/smell/taste:
    • Listen! Can you hear something?
But you can use the continous with see (I'm seeing) when the meaning is having a meeting with:
    • I'm seeing the manager tomorrow morning.

C)

He is selfish and He is being selfish
I'm being = I'm behaving / I'm acting.
    • I can't understand why he's being so selfish. (behaving selfish at the moment. He isn't usually like that.)
    • He is very selfish. (He is selfish generally, not only at the moment.)

look and feel
    • You look well today. or You're looking well today.
    • How do you feel now? or How are you feeling now? but

    • What were you doing at 10 o'clock last night?

    • I saw you in the park yesterday. You were sitting on the grass and reading a book.

Compare:

Yet = 'until now' and shows that the speaker is expecting something to happen. Use yet only in questions and negative sentences.

    • Has it stopped raining yet?
    • I've written the letter but I haven't posted it yet.

D)

Note the difference between gone (to) and been (to)

    • Everything is going well. We haven't had any problem so far.
    • I'm hungry. I haven't eaten anything since breakfast. (from breakfast until now)

    • I've drunk four cups of coffee today. (perhaps I'll drink more before today is finished)
    • Have you had a holiday this year (yet)?
    • I haven't seen Tom this morning. Have you?

10 - Present perfect continuous and simple

I have been doing & I have done

A)

Ann's clothes are covered in paint. She has been painting the ceiling.

Has been painting is the present perfect continuous.

We are interested in the activity. It does not matter whether something has been finished or not. In the example, the activity has not been finished.


The ceiling was white. Now it is blue. She has painted the ceiling.

Has painted is the present perfect simple.

Here, the important thing is that something has been finished. 'Has painted' is a completed action. We are interested in the result of the activity (the painted ceiling), not in the activity itself.


Compare these examples:

    • My hands are very dirty. I've been repairing the car.
    • The car is OK again now. I've repaired it.

    • She's been smoking too much recently. She should smoke less.

A)

Bob and Alice are married. They got married exactly 20 years ago, so today is their 20th wedding anniversary. They have been married for 20 years.

We say:

    • They are married. (present)
    • How long have they been married? (present perfect)
	(not How long are they married?)
    • They have been married for 20 years. 
	(not They are married for 20 years.)

We use present perfect to talk about something that began in the past and still continues now. Compare the present and the present perfect:

    • Ann is in hospital.
    • She has been in hospital since Monday.

    • We know each other very well.
    • We have known each other for a long time. (not we know)

The action can be a repeated action:

    • How long have you been driving? Since I was 17.


C)

I have done (simple) or I have been doing (continuous)

The continuous is more usual with how long, since and for (See also Unit 10B):

    • I've been learning English for a long time.

You can normally use either the continuous or simple with live and work:

    • John has been living / has lived in London for a long time.
    • How long have you been working / have you worked here?

But we use the simple with always:

    • John has always lived in London. (not has always been living)

You can use the continuous or the simple for action repeated over a long period:

    • I've been collecting / I've collected stamps since I was a child.

Some verbs (for example, know / like / believe) are not normally used in the continuous:

    • How long have you known Jane?
    • I've had a pain in my stomach since I got up this morning.

    • I haven't seen Tom since Monday. (= Monday was the last time I saw him.)
    • Jane hasn't phone me for two weeks. (The last time she phoned me was two weeks ago.)

12 - When…? and How long…?, For and since

A: How long has it been raining?
B: It's been raining for an hour / since 1 o'clock.

A: How long have Joe and Carol known each other?
B: They've know each other for a long time / since they were at school.


B)

We use both for and since to say how long something has been happening.

We use for when we say a period of time:

    • I've been waiting for two hours.
    • Sally's been working here for six months.
    • I have't seen Tom for three days.

We use since when we say the start of a period.

    • I've been waiting since 8 o'clock.
    • Sally's been working here since April.
    • I haven't seen Tom since Monday.

It's possible to leave out for (but not usually in negative sentences):

    • They've been married (for) ten years. 
    • They haven't had a holiday for ten years. (you must use for)

We don't use for + all ... (all day / all my life)

C)

We say It's (a long time / two years) since something happened:

    • It's ages since we went to the cinema. (We haven't been to the cinema for ages)

The question is How long is it since...?

    • How long is it since you last saw Joe? (= When did you last saw Joe?)
    • How long is it since Mrs Hill died? (= When did Mrs Hill die?)

13 - Present perfect and past (1)


I have done & I did (1)

A)

Tom is looking for his key. He can't find it.

    • He has lost his key. (present perfect)

This means that he hasn't have his key now. But ten minutes later...Now Tom has found his key. He has it now.

    • Has he lost his key? (present perfect)
    • No, he hasn't. He has found it.

    • Did he lose his key? (past simple)
    • Yes, he did.

    • He lost his key. (past simple)
    • But now he has found it. (present perfect)

The present perfect is a perfect tense. It always tells us something about now. Tom has lost his key. = Tom doesn't have his key now.

The past simple tells us only about the past. If somebody says 'Tom lost his key', we don't know whether he has it or not. We only know that he lost it at some time in the past.

Two more examples:

    • Jack grew a beard but now he has shaved it off. (So he doesn't have a beard now.)
    • They went out after lunch and they've just come back. (So they are back now.)


B)

Do not use the present perfect if there is no connection with the present, for example, things that happened a long time ago.

    • The Chinese invented printing. (not 'have invented')
    • How many plays did Shakespeare write? (not 'has Shakespeare written')
    • Beethoven was a great composer. (not 'has been')

Compare:

    • Shakespeare wrote many plays.
    • My sister is a writer. She has written many books. (She still writes books.)


C)

We use the present prefect to give new information. (see Unit 7). But if we continue to talk about it, we normally use the past simple:

A: Ow! I've hurt myself.
B: How did you do that. (not 'have you done')
A: I picked up a hot dish. (not 'have picked')

A: Look! Somebody has spilt milk on the carpet.
B: Well, it wasn't me. I didn't do it.
A: I wonder who it was then.



$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$


14 - Present perfect and past (2)

I have done & I did (2)

A)

Do not use the present perfect (I have done) when you talk about a finished time (yesterday / ten minutes ago / in 1985 /when I was a child). Use a past tense.

    • The weather was nice yesterday. (not has been nice)
    • They arrived ten minutes ago. (not have arrived)
    • I ate a lot of sweets when I was a child. (not have eaten)
    • A: Did you see the news on television last night? (not have you seen)
	B: No, I went to bed early. (not have gone)

Use a past tense to ask When..? or What time…?

    • When did they arrived? (not have they arrived?)
    • What time did you finish work?

Compare:

    • Tom has lost his key. He can't get into the house.

Here, we are not thinking of the past action. We are thinking of the present result of the action: Tom doesn't have his key now.

    • Tom lost his key yesterday. He couldn't get into the house.

Here, we are thinking of the action in the past. We don't know from this sentence whether Tom has his key now.


B)

Compare present perfect and past:

    • I've done a lot of work today.

We use the present perfect for a period of time that continues from the past until now. For example, today, this week, since 1985.

    • I did a lot of work yesterday.

We use the past simple for a finished time in the past. For example, yesterday, last week, from 1985 to 1991.

    • It hasn't rained this week.
    • It didn't rain last week.

    • Have you seen Ann this morning? (It is still morning.)
    • Did you see Ann this morning? (It is now afternoon or evening.)

    • Have you seen Ann recently?
    • Did you see Ann on Sunday?

    • I don't know where Ann is. I haven't seen her.
